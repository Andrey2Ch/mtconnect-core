# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Node.js project with TypeScript, set up the directory structure, and install required dependencies.
# Details:
1. Initialize a new Node.js project with npm init
2. Install TypeScript and configure tsconfig.json
3. Install required dependencies:
   - express (for REST API)
   - axios (for HTTP requests to MTConnect agents)
   - xml2js (for XML parsing)
   - winston (for logging)
4. Set up directory structure:
   - src/ (for TypeScript source files)
   - src/models/ (for data models)
   - src/services/ (for business logic)
   - src/controllers/ (for API endpoints)
   - src/config/ (for configuration)
   - public/ (for frontend assets)
5. Create basic .gitignore file
6. Set up npm scripts for development, building, and running the application

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure is correctly set up. Ensure all dependencies can be installed without errors. Confirm TypeScript compilation works correctly.
