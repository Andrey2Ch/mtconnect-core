# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Integration Tests for ADAM PoC Full Cycle
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop comprehensive integration tests for the ADAM PoC full cycle, including connection to the Mock server, data reading, JSON mapping, batch sending to Cloud API, performance testing, connection loss handling, and data validation.
# Details:
1. Set up a test environment:
   - Create a new file `tests/integration/adamPocFullCycle.test.ts`
   - Import necessary modules and classes (MockAdamServer, AdamClient, AdamDataMapper, CloudApiClient)

2. Implement test cases:
   a. Mock server connection:
      - Create an instance of MockAdamServer
      - Connect AdamClient to the mock server
      - Verify successful connection

   b. Data reading:
      - Set up AdamClient to read data every 100ms
      - Verify that data is being read at the correct interval
      - Check that the read data matches the expected format

   c. JSON mapping:
      - Pass the read data through AdamDataMapper
      - Verify that the mapped data adheres to the defined TypeScript interfaces
      - Check for correct timestamp, moduleId, machineId, and status

   d. Batch sending to Cloud API:
      - Set up CloudApiClient with a mock endpoint
      - Verify that data batches are being sent correctly
      - Check that the sent data matches the mapped data

   e. Performance testing:
      - Implement a test case that simulates 1000 operations per second
      - Measure and assert that the system can handle this load
      - Monitor memory usage and response times

   f. Connection loss handling:
      - Simulate connection loss from the mock server
      - Verify that the system attempts to reconnect
      - Check that data is buffered during the disconnection
      - Ensure data integrity after reconnection

   g. Data validation:
      - Implement comprehensive data validation tests
      - Check for data consistency across the entire pipeline
      - Verify that all required fields are present and correctly formatted

3. Set up CI/CD pipeline:
   - Create a new file `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml` (assuming GitHub Actions)
   - Configure the workflow to run on push and pull requests to main branch
   - Set up the test environment in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Run the integration tests as part of the pipeline
   - Report test results and code coverage

4. Implement logging and error handling:
   - Add detailed logging throughout the test cases
   - Implement proper error handling and assertions
   - Ensure all edge cases are covered

5. Create a test report generator:
   - Implement a mechanism to generate detailed test reports
   - Include performance metrics, success rates, and any failures

# Test Strategy:
1. Manual Testing:
   - Run the integration tests locally to ensure they work as expected
   - Verify that all test cases pass and provide meaningful output
   - Check that the performance tests accurately measure the system's capabilities

2. Automated Testing:
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to run the integration tests automatically
   - Ensure the pipeline runs on every push and pull request
   - Verify that the pipeline correctly reports test results and code coverage

3. Code Review:
   - Conduct a thorough code review of the integration tests
   - Ensure that all aspects of the ADAM PoC full cycle are covered
   - Verify that the tests are well-structured and follow best practices

4. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test with various network conditions (high latency, packet loss)
   - Verify system behavior under extreme load conditions
   - Test with malformed or unexpected input data

5. Long-running Tests:
   - Implement and run long-duration tests (e.g., 24 hours) to catch any memory leaks or degradation over time

6. Report Validation:
   - Review generated test reports for completeness and accuracy
   - Ensure that performance metrics are correctly calculated and reported

7. Regression Testing:
   - Run the integration tests after any significant changes to the system
   - Verify that new changes haven't broken existing functionality

8. Cross-environment Testing:
   - Run tests in different environments (development, staging, production-like)
   - Ensure consistent behavior across all environments
